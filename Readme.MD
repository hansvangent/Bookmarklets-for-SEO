# Usage
Copy and paste the source code (linked in the titles) prepended with `javascript:` into your bookmarks and open the bookmark to activate it.  
For example, the source code `function example() {};` should look like `javascript: function example() {};` when saving it as a bookmark.  
Note that character limit, comments, and special characters may be an issue when creating a bookmarklet.  
If there is an issue, try running it through [JSObfuscate](https://www.cleancss.com/javascript-obfuscate/) first.
